# LiquidConverter
A small Java console application to convert units of measure.


I am a new developer learning Java.

This application consists of a main method which calls a 'convert()' method. 
The convert method asks the user what their starting unit of measure is, then asks the quantity. It displays a menu prompting the user which unit of measure they would like to convert too.

The menu selection runs a switch statement which calls the individual conversion methods using the user entered values for unit and quantity.

My first 'complete' application, so no negative comments! :)
